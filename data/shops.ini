# Shop #3 shop will be called "Potion Shop".
# It will sell "item #2"s for 100g (and buy them for 50g),
# and sell "item #3"s for 200g (and buy them for 100g).
# You can craft "item #4" with 5x "item #2" and 1x "item #3".
#
# An NPC must be given the vendor id 3 in the pub files to access this shop.
#
# The server will warn you if a sell price is higher than a buy price.
#

# rather than editing this file.
