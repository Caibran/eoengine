# NPC Speech information
#
# Format:
#  id.freq = speech hook frequency (seconds)
#  id.chance = rate that the NPC will speak, expressed as a percentage from 0-100
#  id.speech = Comma-separated list of phrases to speak
#
# Example:
#  7.freq = 60s
#  7.chance = 90
#  7.speech = Beh, Behhhh, I'm a goat
#
# Every 60 seconds, NPC ID 7 will make an attempt to speak
# There is a 90% chance that the NPC will actually speak
# The NPC will randomly select between "Beh", "Behhhh", and "I'm a goat"
#
# Only one NPC that spawns per set of spawn coordinates will actually say anything
#
# It is recommended to create a new file and change the config to point at it
# rather than editing this file.
